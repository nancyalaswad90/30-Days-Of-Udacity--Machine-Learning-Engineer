# 30 Days Of Udacity For ((  Machine Learning-Engineer)) 











Repo to keep track of my progress during the **#30DaysOfUdacity**





.





## What is the #30DaysofUdacity Challenge?





**This challenge** is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment to practicing the topics of your Foundation Course every day for 30 days.



.



**The advantage here**







Because it builds habits that emphasize consistent practice to help the overall retention of new learning material.







**This repo**  is created to make it easy to keep track of my progress during the challenge and to add a visual effect to my progress and commitment by updating my GitHub contribution chart daily **(extra motivation!).**
